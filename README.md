# A-Pathfinding-Visualization-
This is a A* pathfinding algorithm and it finds a path from a source to a destination with visualization

Read more about A* algorithm here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
In this algorithm I have used the A * algorithm for finding the most optimal path from source to destination
The code is written in Python and for visualization I have used pygame, which is a open-source module for python


STEPS ON HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
  1. As you run the program click anywhere inside the gui window and the spot will get filled with orange color, this is the starting node.
  2. Then click in the gui windows again for the end node which will be in Orange color, thus making it the end node
  3. Now time to create some barriers which will be in black color, which will act like a wall for the algorithm. Make as many barriers as you like by clicking inside the gui window
  4. To remove the START, END, or BARRIER node just right click on mouse and it will disappear. 
  5. After all the barriers and start & end node is placed, press 'SPACE' to run the algorithm and it will give you the shortest path from start to end node.
